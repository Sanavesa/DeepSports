# TODO:
- 0.8 dropout after timesformer
- multiple dropouts (like topology)
- Loss = alpha * MSE - beta * Spearman?
	- not differentiable, maybe it is?

	- https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/spearmans-correlation/91931/5
- image preprocessing
	- random cropping
	- random rotation
	- normalize image to -0.5 to 0.5
- different cropping/scaling techniques?
	- run our architecture on 448x448 models
